## Introduction
This project implements an intelligent **Connect 4 AI agent** using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) combined with a Neural Network (NN)**. The goal is to enhance decision-making by leveraging both search techniques and deep learning.

Our approach integrates:
- **MCTS**: A search algorithm that selects moves based on simulated games.
- **Neural Networks**: A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that helps in evaluating board positions and move probabilities.

This hybrid method results in a **stronger, faster, and more reliable** Connect 4 agent compared to traditional MCTS.

## Installing dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Play Against the Neural Network
To challenge the AI, simply **run the main script**:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will start a Connect 4 game where you can play against the AI.

## How It Works
### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
1. **Selection**: The best move is chosen based on past simulations.
2. **Expansion**: The search tree grows by adding new possible moves.
3. **Simulation**: Random games are played to estimate outcomes.
4. **Backpropagation**: The results are used to update move evaluations.

**Weakness**: Standard MCTS relies on random simulations, which can be slow and lead to suboptimal decisions.

### Neural Network Integration
- **CNN Model**:
  - **3 convolutional layers** extract features from the board.
  - **Policy head** predicts move probabilities.
  - **Value head** estimates the win probability.

- **Training Process**:
  - The model is trained using **game data** (board states, moves, outcomes).
  - It optimizes **policy loss** and **win probability loss**.
  - Performance improves over time and is tracked using plots.

### MCTS + Neural Network
- **Policy head** helps MCTS prioritize strong moves.
- **Win probability estimation** improves simulation accuracy.

### Performance Comparison
| Method | Strength | Speed | Decision Quality |
|--------|---------|------|-----------------|
| MCTS (Random) | Moderate | Slow | Inconsistent |
| MCTS + NN | Strong | Fast | Smart & Reliable |
